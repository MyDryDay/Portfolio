                    <p>
                       I am a 23 year old student from Warwickshire, I study computer & data science at Birmingham City University. 
                       Additionally, I am also studying full-stack-web development at a bootcamp run by the University of 
                       Birmingham. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of studying I enjoy video games, taking care of my pets & plants, reading & writing, electronics, and learning 
                        all I can about topics that interest me. I also really enjoy travelling to new places; Japan has been the place I have 
                        enjoyed the most thus far, so much so that I have begun learning the language in the hopes that one day I might be 
                        able to work there.

                                After finishing Sixth Form I briefly went to university to study Electronic Engineering,

                                        I do love interacting with people and am always looking for ways to improve my communication skills.

                                could and couldn't take, keeping the store organised and tidy, and ensuring prescriptions were bagged up correctly.

                                From 2017 to 2018 I had an apprenticeship at a local ALDI store doing retail management. My main

                                ensuring the store was clean & tidy, and providing support to my managers if and when they needed it. In addition 
                                to this I was also being prepared for a manegerial role.

                                allowed me to move onto the next stage; becoming an apprentice manager. This involved me doing all the same duties 
                                as I would if I were a Deputy Manager, these duties included: running shifts & ensuring my team got everything that
