# UoB_BC_Portfolio

# Introduction
This piece of work involved making a responsive portfolio website using bootstrap. For this i had to ensure that the entirety of the site was responsive and changed/responded according to the size of the user's viewport.

## Why did i do this?
The main purpose for doing this particular piece of work was to educate myself on Bootstrap 4.5 and to make sure i could use it effectively to build a responsive website.

### What i learnt
I'd like to think i learnt a great deal about Bootstrap and what it can offer to web developers. I also learnt about the "mobile first" design approach in which developers approach designing sites for mobile users first, and then move onto larger screen sizes.

#### For the future
I would like to alter how the rows and columns displayed on smaller screens in the future. For example, instead of just using the class "col-md-6" i would also add in a class for smaller sized screens: "col-sm-6".
I also think it would be beneficial for me to regularly come back to this site and update it to reflect how i have developed as a web developer.
I'd also like to play with the colour scheme as it's rather bland at the moment.
